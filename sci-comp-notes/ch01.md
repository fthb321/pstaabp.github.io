=============

These are the notes for week 1 of Math 3001.  [Return to all notes](../index.html)

Introduction to Scientific Computing
-------------

Scientific Computing is

* a field of study in which problem solving is done via writing programs (algorithms and code) to solve the problems. 
* a field which requires math or science knowledge to be effective.


Scientific Computing is not

* just writing code
* a substitute for math or science
* a magic bullet to solve any problem

Where is Scientific Computing Used

* making predictions (weather, stock market, traffic, etc.)
* by individuals testing ideas
* in production software 


Numeric Types
-------------

One of the first things that is important is a knowledge of how computers store numbers and other mathematical objects.  The following are links to wikipedia pages with further information:

* [wikipedia's page on integers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science\))
* [wikipedia's page on floating point numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point_numbers)


Julia's standard numbers and mathmatical objects
----------------

Julia has built-in number and other mathematical data types including those listed above in various sizes as well as rational numbers, matrices, and complex numbers.  The following is a
