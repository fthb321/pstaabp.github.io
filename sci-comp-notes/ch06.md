Chapter 6: Loading Packages
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

A package is an extra set of commands or functions.  For example, in the next Chapter we will see the `Primes` package has a few additional commands to help with factoring integers and finding prime numbers.  To load the package, type
```
using Primes
```

Now, there are additional functions.  For example,
```
isprime(17)
```

returns true because 17 is a prime number.   This is a nondeterministic function that determines if a number is true. The documentation for the Primes package is at  [https://github.com/JuliaMath/Primes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Primes.jl) and demonstrates 4 commands including `isprime` and `factor` which returns all prime factors (and the order).


[The Julia Packages Directory]([http://pkg.julialang.org/) lists all of the official packages for Julia.  A few that we have seen or will see:

* IJulia -- provides the browser interface to Julia.  You are probably already using this.
* ForwardDiff -- does Automatic Differentiation (see Chapter 8)
* Plots -- A plotting packages (See Chapter 11)
* GR -- A backend to the Plots package.
* PlotlyJS -- Another nice backend to the Plots package.
* DataFrames -- a way to nicely handle datasets generally loaded from external files.

[Chapter 14](ch14.html) will show how to create our own packages also called a module.
