Chapter 6: Packages
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

A package is an extra set of commands or functions.  For example, the `Primes` package has a few additional commands to help with finding prime numbers.  To load the package, type
```
using Primes
```

Now, there are additional functions.  For example,
```
isprime(17)
```

returns true.  This is a nondeterministic function that determines if a number is true.  The documentation for this can be found by first going to [The Julia Packages Directory]([http://pkg.julialang.org/) and then finding the package name.

The link takes you to [https://github.com/JuliaMath/Primes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Primes.jl) and demonstrates 4 commands including `isprime` and `factor` which returns all prime factors (and the order), similar to what we tried to do with the `allfactors` function.


[The Julia Packages Directory]([http://pkg.julialang.org/) lists all of the official packages for Julia.  A few that we have seen or will see:

* IJulia -- provides the browser interface to Julia
* Plots -- A plotting packages
* PyPlot -- A plotting package with an interface like pythons.
* Gadfly -- A relatively simple plotting package.
