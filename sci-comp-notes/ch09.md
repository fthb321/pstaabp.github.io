Chapter 9: Plotting Data and Functions
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

Plotting is crucial to understanding functions and visualizing data.  There are many ways to do some plots using various packages.  We will investigate two in this chapter.  

### The Gadfly Package

A nice looking and simple-to-use plotting package is the Gadfly package.  You'll need to add it with
```
Pkg.add("Gadfly")
```

and there are a few other packages it depends on.  The full documentation is at [the Gadfly website](http://gadflyjl.org/stable/). Recall that once the package is added, to use it type
```
using Gadfly
```

#### Plotting Functions

You can plot a function with Gadfly with the `plot` command.  For example,
```
plot(x->x^2,-2,2)
```

produces the following plot:

![Plot of \\(y=x^2\\)](images/ch09/plot1.png)

If we want to plot 2 functions on the same axes.

```
plot([x->x^2,sin],-2,2)
```

produces the following:

![Plot of \\(y=x^2\\) and \\(y=\sin(x)\\)](images/ch09/plot02.png)

#### Plotting Data

First, let's start with some random data.  Let
```
pts1=rand(25)
```

```
pts2=rand(25)
```

then `plot(x=pts1,y=pts2)` will produce a scatter plot of the data.  

If we want to connect all of the points with lines instead, type
```
plot(x=pts1,y=pts2,Geom.line)
```

and if you want both, then type
```
plot(x=pts1,y=pts2,Geom.line,Geom.point)
```

### Changing the color of the line

Let's say we have a line plot and want the color to be red.  Here's how to do that:
```
plot(x=pts1,y=pts2,Geom.line,Theme(default_color=colorant"red"))
```

See [the theme section of the Gadfly website](http://gadflyjl.org/stable/man/themes.html) for more information on how to do this.

#### Exercise

* Try changing the size of the points in a point plot.
* Try changing the width and style of the lines in a line plot.


### Data from other sources

In this chapter, we will be using data from a package called `RDatasets`, so it will need to be added.

```
Pkg.add("RDatasets")
```

and then type
```
using RDatasets
```

This package contains a few hundred freely available datasets.  A list of the subpackages can be seen with
```
RDatasets.packages()
```

and then a listing of all of the datasets in each subpackage can be found with
```
RDatasets.datasets("datasets")
```

as an example.  

Finally, let's load the trees dataset from this to view:
```
trees=RDatasets.dataset("datasets","trees")
```

We can perform a scatter plot of the 2nd and 3rd columns of this data with
```
plot(x=trees[:,2],y=trees[:,3])
```

which will give the following plot:

![Plot of tree girth and height data](images/ch09/plot03.png)

#### Dataframes

Although it seems like arrays are a nature way to store data for data analysis, there is something called a dataframe that allows easier access.  

If you type `typeof(trees)` you'll see that julia returns `DataFrames.DataFrame` the internal dataframe type and you can read more about this at [the DataFrames documentation website](http://dataframesjl.readthedocs.io/).  One thing that dataframes allow is to have a mixture of different types, say one column of ints and one column of strings. For example,

```
iris=RDatasets.dataset("datasets","iris")
```

loads data about different species of irises.  The first 4 column are floats and the 5th column is a string.   Each of the columns has a name that we will be able to use more than just by column name.  

To plot a dataframe, for example, if we type:
```
plot(iris,x="SepalLength",y="SepalWidth")
```

we get the following:

![Plot of iris data](images/ch09/plot04.png)

This plot just plotted the two columns of the data.  If we are interested in seeing the species differences, then typing
```
plot(iris, x=:SepalLength, y=:SepalWidth, color=:Species,
         Geom.point)
```

results in

![Plot of iris data subsetted by species](images/ch09/plot05.png)
