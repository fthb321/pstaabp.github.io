Chapter 8: More on Functions
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

This chapter covers a bit more on Functions...

We know how to define an argument with a type, but what if more information is needed for an argument. Recall our factorial function
```
function fact(n::Integer)
  if n==0
    return 1
  end
  n*fact(n-1)
end
```

but what happens if you put in a negative number?  Try it.

We can prevent it with the following:
```
function fact(n::Integer)
    n>=0 || throw(ArgumentError("The argument must be a nonnegative integer."))
  if n==0
    return 1
  end
  n*fact(n-1)
end
```

The first line of this evaluates `n>=0` if that is false, the second after the || is evaluated and an error is thrown.  

Optional arguments
------

Let's return to Newton's method, which we wrote before as

```
function newton(f::Function, df::Function,x0::Number)
    x1=x0
    x2=x0+1
    steps = 0
    while abs(x2-x1)>1e-6 && steps<100
        x1=x2
        x2=x1-f(x1)/df(x1)
        println(x2)
        steps += 1
    end
    x2
end
```

Notice that we hard-coded the stopping criteria and the max number of steps. Let's adapt this function to include the following:

1. Make the stopping condition and max steps as optional parameters.  
2. Check to make sure that they are valid.  
3. If the number of steps exceeds the maximum number of steps, then throw an `ErrorException` and a reasonable message.
