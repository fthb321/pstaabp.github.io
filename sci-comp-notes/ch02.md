Chapter 2: Functions
=============

[Return to all notes](index.html)

In any language, the function is one of the most important ideas and this chapter is a review of functions with examples in julia.   [The Julia documentation on functions](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/functions/) is a great place for details.

Simple example
-----

A simple example of a julia function is

```
function sq(x)
  x^2
end
```

which just returns the square of the argument, called x.  An alternative way to do this is the following:
```
f(x)=x^2
```

Check that both `sq` and `f` return what is expected.  

Return statement
----

In the function `sq` the returned value is the last line of the function.  If you want to return a value before the last line you can use the `return` command.  The following will return true if the number is odd and false if the number is true:

```
function isOdd(n)
  if mod(n,2)==1
    return true
  end
  false
end
```

The `mod` function is the remainder of n divided by 2.  If the remainder is 1, then the number is odd.  The function is returned from that line.

A better way to write this (but doesn't use the return statement) just evaluates if `mod(n,2)` is 1 or not:

```
function isOdd(n)
  mod(n,2)==1
end
```

Exercise
---

* Write a function that returns the mean (average of 3 numbers)

Variable Number of arguments
-----

From the last exercise, it would be unfortunate if we have to write different functions for different number of arguments.   We can write a variable number of arguments with a ... trailing the last argument.  The following is a generalized version of the mean:

```
function themean(x...)
    sum=0
    for i=1:length(x)
        sum+=x[i]
    end
    sum/length(x)
end
```

Specifying Argument Types
----

The `isOdd` function above should only work on integers, but if you type reals it still works.  (But does it give you want you want?).  What if you put in a string like "hi"?  

If instead, you specify a type in the following way:

```
function idOdd(n::Integer)
   mod(n,2)==1
end
```

and restart the kernel (either in Jupyter using *Kernel*->*Restart* or via the `workspace()` function.  We'll talk later about why you need to do this).  Check and see what happens if you try `idOdd` on a non integer or a string.

Exercise
-----

* redo the `mean` function from above (the 3 argument one) using a type for the argument. Since both floats and integers are numbers, use the abstract `Number` type for this.  Restart the kernel and test your function.  


Multiple Return Values
-------------

A very nice feature of Julia functions is that of multiple return values.  Instead of only being able to return a single number (or requiring to send an array or object), you can return more than 1 number (or other data type). For example.

```
function h(x,y)
  x+y,x-y
end
```
and if you call this, say `h(3,5)` you will get the result `(8,-2)` or if you say
```
p,q=h(3,5)
```
the p will take on the value 8 and q will be equal to -2.  




Factorial Function
-----

Mathematically, we define the factorial as a function on a non-negative integer as
\\[ n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \\]

or the product of all of the numbers from itself down to 1.  There are a number of ways to program this function as we will see.  The following is a way using a `for` loop

```
function fact(n::Integer)
    prod=1
    for i=1:n
        prod *= i
    end
    prod
end
```

We store the result (product) in a variable called prod and multiply all of the numbers up to `n`.  

Exercise
----

* Test the function above for various positive integers.
* What happens if you put in 0 or a negative integer?
* What happens if you put in a number that is not an integer?

Recursive Functions
------

Another type of function is one that calls itself and is called a *recursive function*.  One of the standard examples of this is the factorial function.   


Above, we saw how to compute the factorial of a number using a for loop.  There&#8217;s another way to do this.  We can define the factorial in the following way:
$$ n!=\begin{cases}1&n=0\newline n\cdot(n-1)!&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

The big difference is that inside the function is a call to the function.  This is what is called a recursive function.  Often this is very helpful and the factorial is a great example of this.  We can write the factorial this way in the following:

```
function factr(n::Integer)
   if n == 0 then
      return 1
   else
      return n*factr(n-1)
   end if
end
```

Exercise
-----

A common recursive function is that of a Fibonacci number.  If we let $f(0)=1$, $f(1)=1$, and then
\\[ f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)\\].  Write a recursive function that produces fibonacci numbers.  Test it on small values of $n$.
