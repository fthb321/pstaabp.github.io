Absolute and Relative Errors
--------

Consider an algorithm that tries to find the value of \\(x^{\star}\\).  If the algorithm actually returns the value \\(x\\), then there will be some error.  The **absolute error** is
\\[ |x - x^{\star}|\\]
and the **relative error** is
\\[ \left|\frac{x-x^{\star}}{x^{\star}}\right|\\]

###Example

Consider an algorithm that returns \\(x=0.0153\\) and the actual answer is \\(x^{\star}=0.0150\\).  Find both the absolute and relative errors.

The absolute error is \\(|0.0153-0.015|= 0.0003\\) and the relative error is
\\[ \left|\frac{0.0153-0.015}{0.015}\right|=0.02 \\]


Rounding Errors and the Quadratic Formula
------------

The following example shows how a well-know formula (the quadratic formula) can lead to incorrect results due to rounding errors.  

Remember if you solve \\(a{x}^{2}+bx+c=0\\), the the quadratic formula finds the solution:
$$ x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac} } {2a}$$

Next, let's consider the quadratic equation \\(12.242{x}^{2}+42.382x+0.0012=0\\)

We are going to solve this using the quadratic equation in julia

1. Write a function for the quadratic formula.

	```
	qSol = function(a::Number,b::Number,c::Number)
	       d=sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)
	       return (-b+d)/(2*a),(-b-d)/(2*a)
	end
	```
  (Exercise) Use the quadratic formula to solve \\({x}^{2}-x-110=0\\).


2. Solve the equation \\(12.242{x}^{2}+42.382x+0.0012=0\\) using 64-bit floating point.  

	```
	x1a,x1b = qSol(12.242,42.382,0.0012)
	```
	leads to
	```
	(-2.831413841486606e-5,-3.461987696317393)
	```

3. Find the solution if the coefficients are 16-bit floating points.

	```
	x2a,x2b = qSol(Float16(12.242),Float16(42.382),Float16(0.0012))
	```
	leads to
	```
	(0.0001448952f0,-3.4615362f0)
	```

4. Assume that the 64-bit answer is correct.  Find the absolute and relative errors for the two solutions.

	The absolute errors are
	```
	abs(x1a-x2a) = 0.00017320933367737267
	abs(x1b-x2b) = 0.0004515272652687585
	```

	and the relative errors are:
	```
	abs(x1a-x2a)/abs(x1a) = 6.117414951479887
	abs(x1b-x2b)/abs(x1b) = 0.00013044129635438729
	```

	This shows that the first answer is far off in relative terms.  



Be skeptical of numerical answers
--------------

Even though the example above was manufactured to produce bad results, you never know if a numerical solution is accurate or not.  


Can we ever be confident of answers?
--------------

It's crucial to have a good sense of the problem (whether it be mathematical or a scientific question).  Additionally, testing is an important part of the solution process.  


Let's reexamine the quadratic formula.  The problem arose due to roundoff.  


Let's change the quadratic formula
--------------

I'm going to assume that \\(b>0\\) and let \\(d=\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}\\). The roundoff occurs when the value of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) are close to each other.  In the case above, b=42.382 and \\(d=\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}=42.38130675663505\\).  Notice that the other root (solution) was correct to many decimal places.

To change the quadratic formula we are going to exchange the addition with a subtraction (however we will not have the catastrophic subtraction error we saw above).  "How can you do that you ask?" Here we go...

Start with the quadratic formula (only the + root):
\\[ x=\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}} {2a}\\]

Multiply by a convenient form of 1
\\[ x=\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}} {2a} \cdot \frac{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}\\]


\\[ x = \frac{b^{2}-(b^{2}-4ac)}{2a(-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac})}\\]

\\[ x= \frac{4ac}{2a(-b-\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac})}\\]

\\[ x = -\frac{2c}{b+\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}\\]

and there is a similar solution if the - root is taken above.  So an alternative quadratic formula is:

```
qSol2 = function(a::Number,b::Number,c::Number)
  d=sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)
  return -2*c/(b+d),(-2*c)/(b-d)
end
```

### Exercise

* Use the new quadratic formula (`qSol2`) to find the roots of \\(x^{2}-x-110=0\\).  Do you get the same results as above?

*  Use the new quadratic formula to solve \\(12.242{x}^{2}+42.382x+0.0012=0\\).  Find the absolute an relative errors.  What results do you find?



Newton's Method
------------

Solving an equation is a very important part of mathematics and other scientific fields.  However, finding general solutions to equations is not very easy.  Consider a cubic equation like \\( x^{3}-10x^{2}+24x-17 \\).    In the spirit of (but not very simple) the quadratic formula, there is a [cubic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Roots_of_a_cubic_function).  Much of the wikipedia page spends time solving the cubic with all possibilities.  In short, it's not very easy.

In lieu of using such a formula, a more robust approach is to solve it numerically.  Let's consider


\\[15{x}^{3}-143{x}^2+226x+280=0\\]

This cubic actually factors, but finding those factors is quite difficult to do in general.  We then look at using [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to solve this.

Newton's method starts with a "guess" at the root and then refines it.  Let \\(x_0\\) be the guess, then
\\[x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}\\]

Let's look at this in Julia for the function above.  

```
f(x)=15x^3-143x^2+226x+280
```

and we need the derivative so

```
df(x)=45x^2-286x+226
```

Let's say that x0=0 and find x1 using Newton's method:

```
x0 = 0
x1 = x0-f(x0)/df(x0)
```

returns `-1.238938053097345`.  If we then let x0=x1 and repeat we get a sequence that hopefully gets close to a root (solution). After a few iterations, you should get `-0.8`

### Exercise

* Try to find the other two solutions to this function.  (Hint: try different values for x0)

* Write a function using the arguments f,df and x0 and returns the root.  The shell of the function should look like
```
function newton(f::Function,df::Function,x0::Number)

end
```

and if `f` and `df` are functions as defined above, then `newton(f,df,0)` should return a root of f.  

[//]: # (Newton's Method)

[//]: # (This is the function that we derived in class:)

[//]: # (function newton(f,df,x0))

[//]: # (local found = false, x=x0,n=0)

[//]: # (while(!found && (n<50)))

[//]: # (n+=1)

[//]: # (x=x-f(x)/df(x))

[//]: # (found = abs(f(x))<1.0e-12)

[//]: # (end)

[//]: # (return x)

[//]: # (end)
