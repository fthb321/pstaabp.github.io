Chapter 5: Functional Programming
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

This chapter introduces ideas of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), which is a way to think about programming using functions.  Typically this requires a language that falls into the category of a *functional computer language*, one of which is Julia.  In short, a language that has this feature has a function (or procedure) as a fundamental element of the language and one of which can be passed as arguments.  

Functional vs. Statement-based languages (Not the terminology)
------

Let's look at a relatively simple example of taking an array of integers from 1 to 5 and producing another array which is the square of each number.  In a statement-based point-of-view:

```
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
newarr=[]
for num in arr
  push!(newarr,num^2)
end
newarr
```

which returns the array `[1,4,9,16,25]`. There are other variations on this.  From a functional point-of-view, a common method is a `map` command which takes in an array and produces another array in which a function acts on each element of the array.  In this case, the function is the square.

```
f(x)=x^2
arr=[1,2,3,4,5]
map(f,arr)
```

or more simply using an **anonymous function**,

```
map(x->x^2,arr)
```

The key to this example is the ability to pass the function as an argument to the `map` command.  


### Exercise

1. Write a statement-based loop to take the array `[1,2,3,4,5]` and output an array that is the reciprocal of each number.

2. Write a functional-based code using the `map` command to do the same.

### `map!`

So maybe we can be really excited about the `map` command, but `map!` is similar with an important difference.  Let's say that you need a new array, but the old one isn't important and in this case `map!` is what should be used.  

```
A=[1,2,3,4,5]
map!(x->x^2,A)
```

and now the content of the array `A` is `[1,4,9,16,25]`.  Check it by just typing `A`. 



## Reducing an array

The `map` command in general takes in an array and returns an array.
