Newton's Method
------------

Solving an equation is a very important part of mathematics and other scientific fields.  However, finding general solutions to equations is not very easy.  Consider a cubic equation like \\( x^3-10x^2+24x-17 \\).    In the spirit of (but not very simple) the quadratic formula, there is a [cubic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function#Roots_of_a_cubic_function).  Much of the wikipedia page spends time solving the cubic with all possibilities.  In short, it's not very easy.

In lieu of using such a formula, a more robust approach is to solve it numerically.  Let's consider


\\[15{x}^{3}-143{x}^2+226x+280=0\\]

This cubic actually factors, but finding those factors is quite difficult to do in general.  We then look at using [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to solve this.

Newton's method starts with a "guess" at the root and then refines it.  Let \\(x_0\\) be the guess, then
\\[x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}\\]

Let's look at this in Julia for the function above.  

```
f(x)=15x^3-143x^2+226x+280
```

and we need the derivative so

```
df(x)=45x^2-286x+226
```

Let's say that x0=0 and find x1 using Newton's method:

```
x0 = 0
x1 = x0-f(x0)/df(x0)
```

returns `-1.238938053097345`.  If we then let x0=x1 and repeat we get a sequence that hopefully gets close to a root (solution). After a few iterations, you should get `-0.8`

### Exercise

* Try to find the other two solutions to this function.  (Hint: try different values for x0)

* Write a function using the arguments f,df and x0 and returns the root.

[//]: # (Newton's Method)

[//]: # (This is the function that we derived in class:)

[//]: # (function newton(f,df,x0))

[//]: # (local found = false, x=x0,n=0)

[//]: # (while(!found && (n<50)))

[//]: # (n+=1)

[//]: # (x=x-f(x)/df(x))

[//]: # (found = abs(f(x))<1.0e-12)

[//]: # (end)

[//]: # (return x)

[//]: # (end)

Using functions in a separate file
-----------

As we saw last time, the functions we are using get a little larger.  When this happens, it's a pain to type them out everytime we want to use them.  Instead we will place them in a separate file.

Open up a text editor (like Notepad on windows or TextEdit on OSX) and enter the following function
```
function newton(f,df,x0)
    local found = false, x=x0,n=0
    while(!found && n<50)
        n+=1
        x=x-f(x)/df(x)
        found = abs(f(x))<1.0e-12
    end
    return x
end
```

save it in a file called `newton.jl` somewhere.

To use it in a julia session, type
```
require("newton")
```

as long as the file is in the same directory as the julia session. If it isn't found, type out the absolute path.

Try it out with
```
newton(x->x^2-4,x->2x,1)
```

which will return 2.0.  

Note:  If you make changes to the file you need to reload it with the command
```
reload("newton")
```

(or the full path)

### Exercise

Save the function in a file.  Type in the `require ` command above and try running newton on the function above or another function.


Complex Numbers
-----------

Last week we briefly saw complex numbers. A site called purplemath.com has a [nice overview of complex numbers](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/complex.htm).  Here's a few example using Julia to do complex arithmetic.

Entering the number \\(a+bi\\) is put in with `a+b*im`.  For example `-2+im` or `0.5*1.5im`.

Operations with complex numbers:
```
(-2+im)^2
(-2+im)*(7+4im)
(-2+im)/(7+4im)
```

Other operations/mathematical functions work as well
```
sqrt(-1+0im)
sin(-2+im)
e^(-5.42+32.3im)=exp(-5.42+32.3im)
```

however, these may not make sense (unless you seen some complex analysis).


Complex Solution to the quadratic equation
---------

Recall that we used the quadratic formula to solve \\(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\\)

```
 function qSol(a,b,c)
       d=sqrt(b^2-4*a*c)
       return (-b+d)/(2*a),(-b-d)/(2*a)
 end
```

which works great for quadratic equations with real solutions.  The solution to \\(x^{2}-x-110\\) is 11 and -10.  However, if there is no real solution, like \\(x^{2}+4=0\\), then the function gives:

```
qSol(1,0,4)
ERROR: DomainError
sqrt will only return a complex result if called with a complex argument.
try sqrt(complex(x))
in sqrt at math.jl:131
in anonymous at none:2
```

But if we put in complex coefficients:
```
qSol(1+0im,0im,4+0im)
```

we get
```
(0.0 + 2.0im,0.0 - 2.0im)
```

for the solution.  


Newton's Method with complex numbers
-----

Newton's method works great with complex numbers as well.  In short, we just need to start it with a complex number and it will iterate the same way.  

(Note: the interpretation of using the tangent line to estimate the root isn't quite the same as with real numbers, but it still converges to a root.)


Let's use this to solve \\(x^{2}+5=0\\), which should have the solution \\(x=\pm i\sqrt{5}\\).  First, define
```
f(x)=x^2+5
```

and
```
df(x)=2x
```

and if we do `newton(f,df,1.0)` then the result stays in the real number and we get `-11.659358758975838` but this isn't the solution.

However, if we type `newton(f,df,1im)`, the the solution 0.0 + 2.236067977499978im.  

###Exercise

The equation \\(x^{3}-1=0\\) has one real root and two complex ones.  Use newton's method to find all of them.
