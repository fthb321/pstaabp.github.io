Chapter 16: Data, Data everywhere
=========

Data is ubiquitous these days and it is often crucial to analyze or plot the data.  We've seen some basic plots in julia and now we work with some other datasets.  We will mainly work with `DataArrays` and `DataFrames` in this section, which are part of the `DataFrames` package.  

### Load the DataFrames Package

As before,
```
using DataFrames
```

and then let's create a `DataArray` using the `@data` macro

```
data=@data([1,2,3,4])
```

and we can find the mean for example, using `mean(data)` just like a regular array and we get:

One of the huge advantages to the `DataArray` type is the ability to include an `NA` for a missing number.   To explain, what this does, try `NA+1`, `3*NA` etc.  Note that you always get `NA` because doing arithmetic with a missing number results something unclear.

If we have
```
data2=@data([1,2,3,4,NA])
```

and try to find the mean results in `NA`. If you want to ignore the `NA`, you can

```
mean(dropna(data2))
```

and the result will be the man without the `NA` values.  

### Data Frames

A data frame is a way to store 2D data such that each column is a DataArray.  To create one, try
```
df = DataFrame(A = 1:4, B = ["M", "F", "F", "M"])
```

which is printed out nicely like:
```
A	B
1	1	M
2	2	F
3	3	F
4	4	M
```




###Getting data from a file

Download the file [Gaz_ua_national.txt](Gaz_ua_national.txt) and save it somewhere that you can access it from Julia. This file has a lot of census data that we will try to find answers.  

###Load in the data

The data is a CSV file with tab delimeters and information about the data is [on the census website](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2010.html)  To load it in type:
```
census_data=readtable("Gaz_ua_national.txt",separator='\t')
```

and readtable returns a dataframe, but doesn't print it out.  It is often helpful to see the top few lines using
```
head(census_data)
```


Here's a few questions we may want to know:

1. What are the top 10 areas in population
1. Give a histogram plot in terms of population?  (What are good bin sizes?)
2. What is the total population of all areas?
2. What the top 10 area in housing units?
2. What is the total number of housing units?
2. What is the average number of people per housing units for all areas?
2. For the top 10 area in population, find the average number of people per housing unit?
2. What are the top 10 areas in land size?
3. What are the top 10 areas in water size?
4. What are the Massachusetts areas in the data?
5. What is the average population, median and standard deviation  of the areas?



###Getting the data into a reasonable form:

One of the great things about DataFrames and the `readtable` function is that it usually detects the datatype and converts it to a proper form.  

The only issue with this is the GEOID, which should be a string instead of an Int64.  We need to actually go back and reread in the data.  If we
```
census_data=readtable("Gaz_ua_national.txt",separator='\t',eltypes=[String,String,String,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Float64,Float64,Float64,Float64])
```

then the GEOID is now a String.  Check it.

###Sorting Data Frames

We can sort the data frames with the `sort!` function.  For example, if we want to sort by the `POP10` column, we can
```
sort!(census_data,cols=[:POP10])
```

and the result is the first 30 rows of the census_data printed out.  We probably want the last 30 rows (or to sort in reverse), which we can get with:
```
sort!(census_data,cols=[:POP10],rev=true)
```

### Filtering the data

Let's try to find all of the location to the west of 120 degrees west longitude.  This is store in the column INTPTLONG.  We can find all of these by doing:

```
west = census_data[census_data[:INTPTLONG].<-120,:]
```

where you need to make sure to use `.<` as a vector version of less than.  We can see how many places there are by doing
```
size(west)
```

and getting `(279,11)` or 279 areas west of 120 degrees west.  

One of our questions in the list above is to find the areas in Massachusetts.  How can we do that?   We can use the `contains` function to determine if the `NAME` contains "MA".  The following will do just this:

```
census_data[map(a->contains(a,"MA"),census_data[:NAME]) .== true,:]
```

It's not quite as nice as the previous example due to the type needed to extract the rows of a data frame.  It's important that the array passed into the first slot of the array must be a Boolean Array.  


### Histograms of data

If we plot a histogram using Gadfly using:

```
plot(census_data,x=:POP10,Geom.histogram)
```

we get a plot with a large peak on the left and nothing much anywhere else.  This is mainly almost all of the area in the table have very few people in them.

```
plot(census_data,x=:POP10,Geom.histogram(bincount=10))
```

however, this still doesn't look quite right.  

###Olympic Athletes

Download the file [OlympicAthletes_0.csv](OlympicAthletes_0.csv) and save it somewhere that you can access it from Julia.  It would be a good idea to open it in a spreadsheet (like excel).

You'll first need to load it in and store each data type in the correct format.

Here's some questions to answer:

1. What is the total number of medals given in all Olympics in the dataset.
2. Collectively taking each olympics, give the top 10 athletes by number of medals.
3. Who had the most olympic gold medals in the Summer 2000 games?  How many medals?
4. Who has the most Olympic Silver medals in the data set (Collectively over multiple olympics)
5. Find some other interesting questions and answer them.
