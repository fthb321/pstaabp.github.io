Chapter 13: Parallel Computing
=====

Briefly, parallel computing is a method of running code on multiple processors (or multiple cores of the same processor) at the same time.  In general, this is a difficult task depending on where data is stored and retrieved.  The [Julia Documentation on parallel computing](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/parallel-computing/) is a good place to start.

Let's start with something relatively simple. Consider the following code:
```
 function count_heads(n::Int)
    c::Int = 0
    for i=1:n
        c += rand(Bool)
    end
    c
end
```

which mimics flipping a coin `n` times.  We can simulate flipping 10 billion coins and finding the fraction that is heads by the following:

```
@time count_heads(10^10)/10^10
```

which returns
```
29.597828 seconds (6.25 k allocations: 263.473 KB)

0.5000025478
```

or about 30 seconds.  We now wish to run it simultaneously on 2 cores (which is what my machine has).  

To do this, we will need to do a few things:

###Open up a terminal window

1. put the `count_heads` function in a separate file called "count-heads.jl"

1. Open up a terminal window (Terminal on Mac and cmd on Windows).  Type `julia`.  If julia is not in the path, you will get an error.  If you have an error, go to [the installing julia chapter](../julia.html) and follow the steps.  

2. If you opened julia, type `nprocs()`.  This may give you a hint on the number of cores.   Exit julia by typing `exit()`.

3. Make sure that you are in the directory that you have your julia files.  If not use `cd` (on windows, Mac and linux) to navigate to the correct directory.   Type `julia -p 4`, where 4 is the number of cores.  

4. type
    ```
    @time count_heads(10^10)
    ```

    to determine how long it takes to flip 10 billion coins.  (Mine took about 30 seconds).

4. type
    ```
    @everywhere include("count-heads.jl")
    a= @spawn count_heads(5*10^9); b= @spawn count_heads(5*10^9); @time fetch(a)+fetch(b)
    ```

      and you should see a halving of the time above. My machine reports about 15 seconds.   

5. You can also try spawning more processing if you have more cores.  



### Parallel for loops

One issue with what we did above is that we have to think about spawning to

```
@time nheads = @parallel (+) for i=1:10^10
         Int(rand(Bool))
       end
```

### Writing a parallel card simulator

```
function para_check_hand(N::Int,f::Function)
       local num1= @spawn check_hand(div(N,2),f)
       local num2= @spawn check_hand(div(N,2),f)
       fetch(num1)+fetch(num2)
end
```

and then we can time it:

```
@time para_check_hand(10^7,is_full_house)
```

and this returns:
```
7.577296 seconds (2.68 k allocations: 115.470 KB)
14268
```

to compare it,

```
@time check_hand(10^7,is_full_house)
```

returns
```
15.470629 seconds (160.00 M allocations: 8.643 GB, 5.79% gc time)
14708
```

or twice the time.
