Chapter 7: Arrays
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

Arrays are a fundamental data structure for nearly every computer language and it is a crucial for scientific computing therefore it is important for julia.  It is recommended to read the [julia documentation on arrays](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.5/manual/arrays/)

In short an array is a collection of data of (typically) the same type under the same name.  We have seen arrays before.  For example, if we say
```
arr = [1,2,3]
```

Then we get a 1-dimensional array of length 3.  Note that when returned, julia says `3-element Array{Int64,1}:` which means

* it is length 3 (since it is a 3-element)
* The internal type is Int64
* it is 1-dimensional, because the 1 as the second element in the {}.  

There are some basic functions that tell us some information:

* `length(arr)` returns 3, the length.
* `eltype(arr)` returns `Int64`, the type of the elements in the array.

### Contructing arrays

We can create arrays in many ways.  As seen above, the line
```
arr=[1,2,3]
```

creates a 1-D array of length 3.  If we know the element, a 2D array can be made like:
```
arr2=[1 2 3; 4 5 6]
```

and this returns:
```
2Ã—3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 4  6  7
```

and note that there is now a 2 after the comma in the {}.  This indicates it is a 2 dimensional array.  

 The following built-in functions are also helpful:

* `zeros(type,dims...)` makes an array of all zeros with datatype `type` and given dimensions.  For example,
  ```zeros(Integer,4,6)
  ```

    returns an array with 4 rows and 6 columns with integer types.

* `ones(type,dims...)` is similar to `zeros` except it is filled with 1s.

* `rand(dims...)` makes a random array of floating points (uniformly distributed between 0 and 1).  


Comprehensions
-------

If we know the form of an array element, we can use what is called a comphrension to construct it in a compact manner.  For example, a 1D array with the elements 1,-1,1,-1,1,-1 can be made:

```
[(-1)^n for n=0:7]
```

and the following:
```
[m+n for n=1:8,m=1:8]
```

makes an 8 by 8 matrix where each element is the sum of the row and column number.

Accessing elements of an array
------

Let
```
x=[1 2 3]
```

to access the 2nd element, we type `x[2]`.  To get an array of the last two elements, type
```
x[2:3]
```

or
```
x[2:end]
```

where `end` will automatically fill with the index of the last element.  

Let
```
A=[1 2 3; 4 5 6]
```

to access the 1st row, 3rd column, type `A[1,3]`
