Chapter 16: Dictionaries and JSON Files
========

[Return to all notes](index.html)

A dictionary or [associative array](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/collections/?highlight=keys#associative-collections) in Julia is a bit like a dictionary that sits on your bookcase--yes the one that you use to look up words.  It is an array that is indexed by a string, like a definition is indexed by the word.  For example,

```
dict=Dict("A"=>1,"B"=>7,"C"=>-7)
```

The value can be looked up by
```
dict["A"]
```
which returns 1.  A couple of helpful functions on dictionary are `values` which returns all of the values of a dictionary and `keys`, all of the indexes (or keys) of the dictionary.  

For example,
```
collect(values(dict))
```

returns the array `[7,1,-7]` and
```
collect(keys(dict))
```

returns the array `["B","A","C"]` and notice in both cases, the order changed from the way it was put in.  


## JSON files

There are many different types of files that are used to transfer data.  A very common one is a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a way to store data associated with javascript an webpages.  An example (from the wikipedia page) is
```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10021"
  },
  "phoneNumber": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "212 555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "fax",
      "number": "646 555-4567"
    }
  ],
  "gender": {
    "type": "male"
  }
}
```

where many of these are field/value pairs, but also arrays are valid.    

Generally, the use of these is importing or exporting an object in JSON.  For example, the above can be written as a Julia string:

```
str = "{
  \"firstName\": \"John\",
  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",
  \"age\": 25,
  \"address\": {
    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",
    \"city\": \"New York\",
    \"state\": \"NY\",
    \"postalCode\": \"10021\"
  },
  \"phoneNumber\": [
    {
      \"type\": \"home\",
      \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"
    },
    {
      \"type\": \"fax\",
      \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"
    }
  ],
  \"gender\": {
    \"type\": \"male\"
  }
}"
```

and to load this, we need to (maybe you'll need add the `JSON` package and then) load the package:
```
using JSON
```

and parsing the JSON:

```
info = JSON.parse(str)
```

returns

```
Dict{String,Any} with 6 entries:
  "gender"      => Dict{String,Any}(Pair{String,Any}("type","male"))
  "phoneNumber" => Any[Dict{String,Any}(Pair{String,Any}("number","212 555-1234…
  "lastName"    => "Smith"
  "firstName"   => "John"
  "age"         => 25
  "address"     => Dict{String,Any}(Pair{String,Any}("streetAddress","21 2nd St…
```

which is a Dictionary.  (Note that the keys are type `String` but since the values have a mixed type, the type is listed as `Any`).   For example, we can echo the first and last name with:
```
string(info["firstName"]," ",info["lastName"])
```

and we can echo the fax number as
```
info["phoneNumber"][2]["number"]
```

since it is the "number" of the 2nd "phoneNumber".

### writing out/exporting a Dictionary

Let's say we have a restaurant menu stored as the following dictionary:
```
menu=Dict("pancakes"=>Dict("type"=>"Breakfast","cost"=>7.00,"options"=>["Chocolate Chip","Buckwheat"]),
"hamburger"=>Dict("type"=>["Lunch","Dinner"],"cost"=>9.00,"options"=>["Cheddar","Mushrooms","Bacon"]),
"onion soup"=>Dict("type"=>["Lunch","Dinner"],"cost"=>5.00))
```

A good way to store it would be to export it as a JSON format.  typing
```
JSON.json(menu)
```

returns
```
"{\"hamburger\":{\"options\":[\"Cheddar\",\"Mushrooms\",\"Bacon\"],\"cost\":9.0,\"onion soup\":{\"cost\":5.0,\"type\":[\"Lunch\",\"Dinner\"]},\"type\":[\"Lunch\",\"Dinner\"]},\"pancakes\":{\"options\":[\"Chocolate Chip\",\"Buckwheat\"],\"cost\":7.0,\"type\":\"Breakfast\"}}"
```

It can also be easily written to a file if we first define
```
f = open("menu.json","w")
```

then write the menu to the file:

```
JSON.write(f,menu)
```

and make sure to close the file:
```
close(f)
```

and then look at the file "menu.json" in the same directory as where your julia document is.

### Parsing a JSON file.

Let's say that we have a more extensive menu in the JSON file [menu2.json](menu2.json).

To load this file and parse it, first open the file:
```
f2=open("menu2.json","r")
```

then parse the file:
```
menu2=JSON.parse(f2)
```

and don't forget to close the opened file `f2`:
```
close(f2)
```

### Exercise

Find the sum of the costs of all of the menu items using the dictionary.
