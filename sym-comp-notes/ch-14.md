Data in Maple
=======

Although there is much better software to use for Data Analysis than Maple, here are some things to know.  

DataFrames
------

In many cases, dealing with data mean dealing with variables of different types.  Because of this, matrices or arrays are not the best storage types.

A `DataFrame` is a common type of data structure across many languages which are designed for use with data. A data frame is a rectangular data structure in which each column has a different type.

Consider the following list of people:


| First Name | Last Name | Gender | Age |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Homer | Simpson | Male | 35 |
| Marge | Simpson | Female | 34 |
| Bart | Simpson | Male | 10 |
| Lisa | Simpson | Female | 8 |
| Margaret | Simpson | Female | 1 |


The age variable should be a number (or perhaps an integer) and the others should be strings.  

We can create a `DataFrame` in the following manner.  

```
firsts:=<"Homer","Marge","Bart","Lisa","Margaret">
lasts:=<"Simpson","Simpson","Simpson","Simpson","Simpson">
genders:=<"Male","Female","Male","Female","Female">
ages:=<35,34,10,8,1>
```

and then
```
DF := DataFrame(`<|>`(firsts, lasts, genders, ages));
```

which produce a structure that looks like:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
 & 1 & 2 &3 & 4 \newline
1 & "Homer" & "Simpson" & "Male" & 35 \newline
2 &  Marge &  Simpson &  Female &  34 \newline
3 &  Bart &  Simpson &  Male &  10 \newline
4 &  Lisa &  Simpson &  Female &  8 \newline
5 &  Margaret &  Simpson &  Female &  1 \newline
\end{array}
\right]$$

where the numbers on the top and left sides are the column and row numbers respectively.  This is nice, however, since the columns represent variables, it would be nice to have that included in the dataframe. In addition, the datatypes can be specified.

```
DF := DataFrame(<firsts, lasts, genders, ages>, columns = <LastName, FirstName, Gender, Age>, datatypes = [string, string, string, integer])
```

The result is:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
 & FirstName & LastName & Gender & Age \newline
1 & "Homer" & "Simpson" & "Male" & 35 \newline
2 &  Marge &  Simpson &  Female &  34 \newline
3 &  Bart &  Simpson &  Male &  10 \newline
4 &  Lisa &  Simpson &  Female &  8 \newline
5 &  Margaret &  Simpson &  Female &  1 \newline
\end{array}
\right]$$


If you want to specify the rows as well (instead of by a number, that can be done with the `rows` option to the `DataFrame`).

If you want to access part of the data frame it is similar to that of an array.  We can access the 2nd row, 4th column, by
```
DF[2,4]
```

or
```
DF[2,Age]
```

We can select the enter row by
```
DF[2,..]
```

And an entire column:
```
DF[..,FirstName]
```

and each of these return a `DataSeries` type.  

Importing Data
---------

Typically data comes from other files or databases.  In many cases,
