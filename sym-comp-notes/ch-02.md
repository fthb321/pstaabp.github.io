Plotting
-----

Most CAS systems will produce very nice plots and Maple is among these.   The standard plot will be that of a function, but we will see that plotting multiple functions and points is also possible.  Maple is very flexible in creating plots. 

###Plotting Functions

In order to plot the expression $x^2$, try typing `plot(x^2)`. You should see a plot similar to 

![Plot of $x^2$](images/ch02/plot1.png)

###Changing the Plotting Window of a plot

Typically, the easiest way to change the plotting window of the plot is to use an option in the plot command. For example, if we want a plot on the domain $\{x \;|\; -2 \leq x \leq 2\}$, then typing `plot(x^2,x=-2..2)` will produce the plot:

![Plot of $x^2$ for $-2 \leq x \leq 2$](images/ch02/plot2.png)

If you want to make sure that the axes include other y values, you can also specify those values. For example, try typing `plot(x^2,x=-2..2,y=-2..2)`.

![Plot of $x^2$ for $-2 \leq x \leq 2$ and $-2 \leq y \leq 2$ ](images/ch02/plot3.png)


If you’d like a title on your plot, you can add the title option. For example, try `plot(x^2,x=-2..2,title=’A plot of the square function’)` and you will see

![Plot of $x^2$ with a title ](images/ch02/plot4.png)

If you try to put the $x^2$ function in the title, you will run into problems. This is due to a typesetting issue. You can add the $x^2$ function by typing `plot,x2,x=-2..2,title=typeset("A plot of ", x2))`. You have called a command called `typeset` that will help Maple understand how to print out what you want. If you search plot in the Help Browser, then scroll down to plot,typesetting, you will find more information and examples to typeset.

###Alternative Way to Change the axes of a plot

You can change the plotting range of plot by selecting the Plot button at the top of the Maple document, then selecting the ”Axes” button. You can change many things about the vertical and horizontal axes. For example, try changing the range on the x-axis to be −2 to 2.

To add a title, right click on the plot, select Title, then Add Title... You can add a mixture of text and math by selecting the appropriate buttons at the top of the Maple document.

###Exercise

Plot $f(x) = \sin x$ on the range $[−6.25, 6.25]$. Give the plot a title that includes the function. 

###Plotting multiple functions
Often, we would like to include more that one function on a single set of axes. Maple allows us to do this easily. Plot $x^2$ as we did above. To add the plot of $x^3$, enter it as an expression. Then drag the expression until is highlighted in blue. Click and hold the mouse on the expression, until a + appears, then drag and drop onto the other axes. You will see a second plot appear.

This is a bit complicated and doesn't always work (or save well).  A better way to do this is to use plot command by typing `plot([x^2 ,x^3 ],x=-2..2)` which results in

![Plots of multiple functions on the same axes  ](images/ch02/plot7.png)

###Adding a Legend

A legend is important for any plot containing more than one function. This allows you to distinguish between the curves. There is a legend option to the plot function. For example, to add a legend and a title to the plot of x2 and x3 type: 

```
plot([x2, x3], x = -2..2,legend = [typeset(x2), typeset(x3)], title = typeset("A plot of %1 and %2.", x2, x3))
```

###Alternative Way to Add a Legend
Alternatively, to add a legend, right-click on the plot, select Legend, then Show Legend, and the legend pops up with the line color of the first curve only. To change the legend on the curve, double click the text next to it.

If there is more than one curve and you want to add that to the legend, select the curve, then right-click select Legend, then Add Lengend and you should see that added to the Legend. Double-click the new legend and change the label. You can do this again with more curves.

I recommend the first way to add a legend because when opening a document and rerunning it (which will be discussed below), Maple tends to not mess up the plot when it is all typed out.  

###Exercise
Graph the functions $\sin x, \sin 2x,$ and $2 \sin x$ on the same coordinate axis. Label your graphs using the legend, and change your plot range to $−2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi$ and $−2.5 \leq y \leq 2.5$.

Plotting Functions with discontinuities
------

If you plot the function $\frac{1}{x-1}$ using the command `plot(1/(x-1),x=-3..3)`
the plot will look like:

The vertical line at $x = 1$ is not part of the course. The line is only because Maple is just connecting a number of generated points with lines. Maple also has a way to detect the discontinuities using the discont=true option. For example, the above is found with
```
plot(1/(x-1),x=-3..3,discont=true)
```
the plot will look like:

Plotting Points
----

Plot a set of discrete points as follows:

1. Enter the expression[^lists]: dots:=[[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[3,0]] 
2. Press Enter
3. Enter the expression: plot(dots,style=point)

and you should see the following plot. 

The points will be plotted as what is called a scatter plot. In order to connect the dots, add the style=line option to the end of the command. 

####Exercise

1. Type `?plot,style` to see other plotting styles. 

2. Graph the points (4, 5), (1, 2), and (−1, 4).

Combining Scatter and Function Plots
-----
We can combine a scatter and function plot in nearly the same way as above. This is best show with an example:
Type out the following:
dots: = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0]]
plot([x^3, sin(x), dots],x=-3..3,y=-3..3)
This will produce a plot that looks like:


  Overall, this looks good, however, the points are not draw as points, but as a sequence of lines. We can fix this by adding a style option, so change the plot command to
plot([x^3, sin(x), dots],x=-3..3,y=-3..3,style=[line,line,point])
where the first two are line plots (the default) and the last is a point plot. You can then add a legend as shown above.


Solving Equations
------

You probably recall from throughout your mathematical career that solving an equation can be difficult.[^solve]  Maple can often solve equations effortlessly. For example if we type
```
solve(x^2-3x-4=0)
```
Maple returns `4,-1`, meaning that both 4 and -1 are solutions to the equation.  


###Exercise

* Open the help page for solve
* what happens if you don't have an equation?      Try solving a linear expression like $2x+4$.

[^lists]: This is a list and will be explained in ??? (link)
[^solve]: Solving equations are difficult for many reasons.  One is that they require you to categorize the equation to determine the type (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc) and they to know (or be creative) to go through steps that result in the solution (or solutions).  Another reason solving is difficult is that many equations do no have an solution that results from performing algebraic steps.
