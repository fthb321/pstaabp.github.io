Differential Calculus Problems in Maple
========

This chapter covers how to perform many mathematics that arises from Calculus using a CAS like Maple.  As we will see, a CAS will often do limits and derivatives quite easily, allowing us to investigate the geometry of the deriviatve using a plot or ...
