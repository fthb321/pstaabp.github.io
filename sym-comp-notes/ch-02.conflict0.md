Plotting
-----

Most CAS systems will produce very nice plots and Maple is among these.   The standard plot will be that of a function, but we will see that plotting multiple functions and points is also possible.  Maple is very flexible in creating plots. 

###Plotting Functions

In order to plot the expression $x^2$, try typing `plot(x^2)`. You should see a plot similar to 

![Plot of $x^2$](images/ch02/plot1.png)

###Changing the Plotting Window of a plot

Typically, the easiest way to change the plotting window of the plot is to use an option in the plot command. For example, if we want a plot on the domain $\{x \;|\; -2 \leq x \leq 2\}$, then typing `plot(x^2,x=-2..2)` will produce the plot:

![Plot of $x^2$ for $-2 \leq x \leq 2$](images/ch02/plot2.png)

If you want to make sure that the axes include other y values, you can also specify those values. For example, try typing `plot(x^2,x=-2..2,y=-2..2)`.

![Plot of $x^2$ for $-2 \leq x \leq 2$ and $-2 \leq y \leq 2$ ](images/ch02/plot3.png)


If you’d like a title on your plot, you can add the title option. For example, try `plot(x^2,x=-2..2,title=’A plot of the square function’)` and you will see

![Plot of $x^2$ with a title ](images/ch02/plot4.png)

If you try to put the $x^2$ function in the title, you will run into problems. This is due to a typesetting issue. You can add the $x^2$ function by typing 

```
plot(x^2,x=-2..2,title=typeset("A plot of ", x^2))
```
You have called a command called `typeset` that will help Maple understand how to print out what you want. If you search plot in the **Help Browser**, then scroll down to `plot,typesetting`, you will find more information and examples to typeset.

###Exercise

Plot $f(x) = \sin x$ on the range $[−6.25, 6.25]$. Give the plot a title that includes the function. 


###Alternative Way to Change the plotting window of a plot

Another way to change the plotting window of a plot is to use the `view` option.  If I just want to see the plot of $x^2$ in the first quadrant, you can type
```
plot(x^2,x=-2..2,view=[0..4,0..4])
```

to get:

![Plot using the view option](images/ch02/plot13.png)

The view option sets the horizontal and vertical range respectively.  


###Plotting multiple functions
Often, we would like to include more that one function on a single set of axes. Maple allows us to do this easily. Plot $x^2$ as we did above. To add the plot of $x^3$, enter it as an expression. Then drag the expression until is highlighted in blue. Click and hold the mouse on the expression, until a + appears, then drag and drop onto the other axes. You will see a second plot appear.

This is a bit complicated and doesn't always work (or save well).  A better way to do this is to use plot command by typing `plot([x^2 ,x^3 ],x=-2..2)` which results in

![Plots of multiple functions on the same axes  ](images/ch02/plot7.png)

###Adding a Legend

A legend is important for any plot containing more than one function. This allows you to distinguish between the curves. There is a legend option to the plot function. For example, to add a legend and a title to the plot of x2 and x3 type: 

```
plot([x^2, x^3], x = -2..2,legend = [x^2, x^3], title = typeset("A plot of %1 and %2.", x^2, x^3))
```

###Alternative Way to Add a Legend
Alternatively, to add a legend, right-click on the plot, select Legend, then Show Legend, and the legend pops up with the line color of the first curve only. To change the legend on the curve, double click the text next to it.

If there is more than one curve and you want to add that to the legend, select the curve, then right-click select Legend, then Add Lengend and you should see that added to the Legend. Double-click the new legend and change the label. You can do this again with more curves.

I recommend the first way to add a legend because when opening a document and rerunning it (which will be discussed below), Maple tends to not mess up the plot when it is all typed out.  

###Exercise
Graph the functions $\sin x, \sin 2x,$ and $2 \sin x$ on the same coordinate axis. Label your graphs using the legend, and change your plot range to $−2\pi \leq x \leq 2\pi$ and $−2.5 \leq y \leq 2.5$.

Changing the Aspect Ratio of a Plot
-------

Often it is important to have an aspect ratio of 1:1 for a plot.  For example, consider a plot of $\sqrt{4-x^2}$, which is the top half of a circle.  If it is plotted on $-3 \leq x \leq 3$, then the curve looks like an ellipse, not a circle.  

If you click on the plot, the toolbar changes to the following:

![Toolbar of a plot](images/ch02/plot-toolbar.png)

And if the 1:1 button is selected, the plot will be forced to have the right aspect ratio. 

###Exercise

Plot the function $\sqrt{4-x^2}$ on $-3 \leq x \leq 3$ and make the plot ratio 1:1. 


Plotting a function with a parameter
--------

Piecewise Functions
--------



Plotting Functions with discontinuities
------

If you plot the function $\frac{1}{x-1}$ using the command `plot(1/(x-1),x=-3..3)`
the plot will look like:

![plot of 1/(x-1)](images/ch02/plot8.png)

The vertical line at $x = 1$ is not part of the graph. The line is only because Maple is just connecting a number of generated points with lines. Maple also has a way to detect the discontinuities using the discont=true option. For example, the above is found with
```
plot(1/(x-1),x=-3..3,discont=true)
```
the plot will look like:

![plot of 1/(x-1)](images/ch02/plot9.png)

and as you can see the line of $x=1$ is not part of the plot.  This is a proper plot and anytime that you plot a function with a discontinuity, you should use the `discont=true` option. 


Plotting Points
----

Plot a set of discrete points as follows:

1. Enter the expression[^lists]:`dots:=[[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[3,0]]` 
2. Enter the expression: `plot(dots,style=point)`

and you should see the following plot:

![plot of a few points](images/ch02/plot11.png)

The points will be plotted as what is called a scatter plot. In order to connect the dots, add the style=line option to the end of the command.

####Exercise

1. Type `?plot,style` to see other plotting styles. 
2. Create a plot that looks like:

![line and point plot](images/ch02/plot12.png)

(Hint: look at the `plot,options` help page for a list of all options and look at the `symbol` and `symbolsize`)

Combining Scatter and Function Plots
-----
We can combine a scatter and function plot in nearly the same way as above. This is best show with an example:
Type out the following:

```
dots: = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0]]
plot([x^3, sin(x), dots],x=-3..3,y=-3..3)
```

This will produce a plot that looks like:


Overall, this looks good, however, the points are not draw as points, but as a sequence of lines. We can fix this by adding a style option, so change the plot command to
  
```
plot([x^3, sin(x), dots],x=-3..3,y=-3..3,style=[line,line,point])
```
where the first two are line plots (the default) and the last is a point plot. You can then add a legend as shown above.


Solving Equations
===

You probably recall from throughout your mathematical career that solving an equation can be difficult.[^solve]  Maple can often solve equations effortlessly. For example if we type
```
solve(x^2-3x-4=0)
```
Maple returns `4,-1`, meaning that both 4 and -1 are solutions to the equation.  


###Exercise

1. Open the help page for `solve`.
2. What happens if you don't have an equation?      Try solving a linear expression like $2x+4$. 
3. Solve the equation $x^2+4xy+2y^2=9$ for $x$, then for $y$.


Solving Trigonometric Equations
------

You should have seen how to solve trigonometric equations (an equation containing trigonometric functions) in Precalculus.  In general these are quite difficult to solve, however Maple can handle many kinds of Trigonometric equations.  Try solving $$\sin 3x = \frac{1}{2}.$$

Maple returns $$\frac{1}{18}\pi$$
which is indeed a solution to the equation.  However, it isn't the only solution.  Recall that the solution(s) of an equation is(are) the point(s) of intersection of the graphs of the functions on either side of the equation.  If we plot the functions $f(x)=\sin 3x$ and $g(x)=1/2$ on the interval $0\leq x\leq 2\pi$ you'll get the following plot:

![plot of the sides of the equation sin(3x)=1/2](images/ch02/plot10.png)

On the interval that we plotted, there are 6 intersection points, but if we changed the plotting interval, that would change.  There are actually an infinite number of intersection points. 

Notice that the solution $\pi/18$ that Maple returned is the smallest intersection point in the plot above.  We also have the ability to find all of them. 

###Finding solutions to equations on an interval

First, let's find the solutions to $\sin 3x=1/2$ that we see on the interval $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$.  The following command will do this
```
Student[Calculus1][Roots](sin(3x)=1/2,x=0..2pi)
```
and you will see 6 roots.  

Now you might (and probably should) be thinking, that's a crazy command to get the solutions.  What's with the brackets?  We will explain this in the next chapter.  In short, it is a way to call a command that is in a library that is not built-in to Maple by default.  We will see a shortcut to call this later.  

###Finding all solutions to a trigonometric equation

And you're asking yourself, "How can I can find all of the solutions?"  Try putting $x=-\infty..\infty$ in for the interval.  What happened?

Okay, that didn't work.  Here's a way to solve $\sin x=0$, which should have the solution that any integer multiple of $\pi$.  If we type:
```
solve(sin(x)=0,x,allsolutions = true)
```
We get $\pi \_Z1$~  (or another number after the Z).  This is a bit strange, but this is Maple's way of saying any integer multiple of $\pi$.  

###Exercise

1. Find all the solutions for $\tan 2x=1$.  
2. Find all the solutions for $\sin 3x =1/2$

Exact versus approximate solutions
------

Using `solve`, Maple will try to find an exact solution to an equation.  Generally, this is what you want.  However, try solving 
$$x^3+3x^2-11x-10=0$$
and you will see a mess (no really, try it).

###Exercise
1. What kind of function is it?
2. How many roots can you get?
3. Plot the function on a window so you see all of the roots (zeros). 
4. What is an estimate of the roots (zeros)?

Maple can automatically find the approximate solutions to an equation using the `fsolve` function.  Try

```
fsolve(x^3+3x^2-11x-10=0)
```
and you should see 3 roots.


Functions
-----

A function in Maple behaves much like a mathematical function, which has a number as an input (or multiple numbers) and returns a number.  You can also think of it as a rule from an $x$ value to a $y$.  For example if we have the square function, the standard way to write it in Maple is
```
f:=x->x^2
```

Note that we use := to assign something to *f* just like we did earlier.  The part on the right side of the :=  is the function and it says that there is an input called *x* (left of the ->, which is a right arrow) and the output on the the left of the ->.   Maple will automatically turn the -> into a single character (glyph) arrow to the right. 

The great thing about functions is that they act much like mathematical functions.  If you have defined the function $f$ as above, now we can do things to functions including

* evaluating functions at points. 
* evaluating functions at other expressions like $x+h$. 
* function composition
* differentiating.  

Try the following:

* $f(2), f(-2), f(10)$.
* $f(y), f(x+1)$
* $$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$
* $f'(2)$
* $f'(x)$
* Define $g(x)=\dfrac{x}{x+1}$ and find $g(f(x))$ and $f(g(x))$.


You can also enter a function in a more-typically type of notation. In standard Maple notation, you should have typed out

``` g:=x->x/(x+1)```

however, if you instead typed

```g(x):=x/(x+1)```

Maple opens a "Clarify Expression" popup window and you need to determine if it is a function defintion or a table assigment.  Because Maple is confused, Maple asks how to interpret things.  I prefer to not get an annoying popup window and use the -> style of function definition.  Throughout the rest of these notes, we will use the maple style.  

[^lists]: This is a list and will be explained in Chapter 3.
[^solve]: Solving equations are difficult for many reasons.  One is that they require you to categorize the equation to determine the type (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc) and they to know (or be creative) to go through steps that result in the solution (or solutions).  Another reason solving is difficult is that many equations do no have an solution that results from performing algebraic steps.
