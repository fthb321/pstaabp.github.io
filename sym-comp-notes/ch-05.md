Advanced Computing Techniques in a Computer Algebra System
==================

The following are number of advanced techniques in Maple.  Again, these are general ideas that appear in any CAS, but the format will be specific to Maple.  These allow a user of Maple to create more complicated series of mathematical steps in a nice way. The following techniques are described here:

* *procedures*  These are similar to functions that we saw earlier, but allow more complicated steps to occur. 
* *boolean values*  A boolean is something that is either true or false.  
* *if and while statements*  An if statement allows a few statements of code to branch depending on some condition.  A while statement allows for a few statements of code to continue to run until a condition occurs. 
* *loops*  A loop is a few statements of code that is run generally a fixed number of times. 
* *recursion*  Recursion is a type of procedure that allows code to call itself.  Although often you can generate code that duplicates recursive code, it is often clearer to understand and often come directly from mathematical statements. 
* *libraries*  We have used libraries in this class and here we will create a small one. 

Procedures
-------

A procedure is very similar to a function in any computer language.  In Maple, these are similar in that there is a input (or a number of inputs) and the result is some output (numbers, a plot, an expression).  In fact, all commands in Maple are just procedures. 

Recall that if we have a simple function that returns the square of a number, we can write that as
```
f:=x->x^2
```

We can also define a procedure in a similar manner. 
```
F:=proc(x::numeric)::numeric;
return x^2:
end proc:
```

A few things to note with this

* This is much more complex to write out than the equivalent function. 
* To get a line inside a procedure without evaluating it, type SHIFT-ENTER
* A procedure allow more complicated structures as we will see. 
* You can call this in the same way, $F(2),F(-2)$ for example. 
* The types of input is defined for us (these are options).  We can only use this to square numbers (integers, decimals, etc.)
* You will notice an error if you do $F(x+1)$.  

We can use this procedure to square numbers, but not expressions.  

Let's also examine a similar procedure that adds numbers:
``` 
add:=proc(x::numeric,y::numeric)::numeric;
return x+y:
end proc:
```

###Exercises

1. remove the semicolon and colon off the end of the lines of the procedure, reenter it and see what happens.  Can you understand what is going on?
2. Write a procedure called `mult` that multiplies two numbers and returns the product. 
3. Write a procedure called `average` that returns the average of three numbers. 

Boolean values and  if statments
------
A boolean value is something that is either `true` or `false`.  These are built-in constants in Maple.  Sometimes we will want to know if a statement is true or false, but generally, we will use them in other structures.  

###if statements

An `if` statement is often used inside of a procedure to do different things depending on the value of a variable.  Consider the piecewise version of the absolute value.  Mathematically, we write:
$$ |x| = \begin{cases} x & x \geq 0 \newline 
-x & x<0 
\end{cases} $$

We can make a Maple procedure for the absolute value the following way:

```
absol := proc(x::numeric)::numeric;
  if x >= 0 then
     return x:
  else
     return -1*x:
  end if:
end proc:
```

And to help determine if it is correct, evaluate `absol(3)` and `absol(-7)`.  

###Exercise

The modulus of an integer is the remainder in division.  For example, 7 mod 3 is 1.  

Write a procuedure call `isOdd` that take a postive integer (type `posint`) and returns boolean if the number is odd.  Use the modulus with the divisor 2.  


###while loops

Another very common construction for programming is called a while loop.  Basically, we want to run a few statements while some boolean statement is true.  Here's a simple example:

```
n:=1
while n<10 do
  print(n):
  n:=n+1:
end do:
```

And that isn&#8217;t very interesting, but we can reproduce the `seq` command crudely in the following way.  Let&#8217;s say we want to return a list of numbers from 1 to $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. 

```
intList := proc (n::posint)::list;
   local list, i; 
   list := []; 
   i := 1; 
   while i <= n do 
     list := [op(list), i]; 
     i := i+1:
   end do 
   return list: 
end proc
```

Some examples:

* typing `intList(6)` returns `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
* typing `intList(10)` returns `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`



The following is a more interesting example.  If you have a positive integer $n$, the follow returns a list of all factors of $n$.  Recall that for a positive integer $n$, the factors of $n$ are all numbers that divide $n$ evenly.  Both 1 and $n$ are always factors of $n$.   

```
allfactors:=proc(num::posint)::posint;
  local factors, n; 
  factors := [1]; 
  n := 2; 
  while n <= num do 
    if num mod n = 0 then 
      factors := [op(factors), n] 
    end if: 
    n := n+1: 
  end do; 
  return factors 
end proc
```
And here&#8217;s a couple of examples of this

* type `allfactors(6)` returns `[1,2,3,6]`
* type `allfactors(29)` returns `[1,29]`


Another possible procedure that you want is to determine if a number is prime.  Although this is built-in, let&#8217;s find a way to do this using the allfactors command. 

```
isThisPrime := proc (n::posint)::boolean; 
  local factors := allfactors(n); 
  return evalb(factors[2] = n) 
end proc:
```

We want to find the smallest prime number bigger than a number n.  We will make a procedure that return the next prime.  We will use the built-in function `isPrime`.  

```
theNextPrime := proc(n::integer)::integer;
  local k := n+1: 
  while not(isThisPrime(k)) do
     k := k+1
  end do:
  return k:
end proc:
```


###Exercise

A perfect number is a positive integer $n$, that has the property that the sum of the factors (other than $n$ itself) equals $n$.  We will write a few procedures here to find perfect numbers.  





1. Write a procedure called `isPerfect` which takes a positive integer, $n$ and return either true or false on whether or not $n$ is a perfect number.

2. Write a procedure called `nextPerfect` which takes an integer, $n$ and return the next perfect number greater than $n$.  







Loops
-----
A *loop* is a series of statements that are repeated either a fixed number of times or until a condition occurs.  They can be very helpful if a large number of operations need to be done in a predictable manner.  

###For loops

The following is a simple for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10
```
for i from 1 to 10 do
  print(i):
end do:
```

This isn&#8217;t a very interesting example, but shows the syntax of a for loop.  

Often a for loop is used in conjunction with a procedure.  If Maple didn&#8217;t have a factorial builtin, here&#8217;s a way we could handle it. 

```
facty:=proc(n::integer)::integer;
   local i,fact:=1:
   for i from 1 to n do
     fact:=fact*i:
   end do:
   return fact:
end proc:
```

and the heart of this is that the for loop multiplies all of the numbers from 1 to n together (it does this one step at a time).  

Note: if you call this function `factorial`, you will get a warning from Maple, which is why it is called `facty`.  

Also, there are two variables that live inside the procedure: i and fact.  Because they are not needed outside the procedure, we declare them **local**.  

Rootfinding techniques 
------

Before continuing with this chapter, we look at a way to find the zeros (or roots) of a function.  Although Maple (and most CASs) have this built-in, we examine the details here.  

Consider the function $f(x)=x^2-2$, which is plotted below:

![Plot of $x^2-2$](images/ch05/plot01.png)

It has two roots $x=\sqrt{2}$ and $x=-\sqrt{2}$.  We will use this example to find a numerical approximation of this.  

If we evaluate the function at $x=0$ and $x=2$, note that $f(0)=-2$ and $f(2)=2$.   The intermediate value theorem states that if a function $f$ is continuous on an interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ takes on all values ($y$-values or heights) between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Specifically if $d$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there exists at least one value $c$ such that $f(c)=d$.  See [this page](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/intermediate-value-theorem.html) for more information.  

For this example, $f$ is continuous, so $f$ takes on all values between $f(0)=-2$ and $f(2)=2$, including 0.  That is, there is a number $c$ such that $f(c)=0$.  The value of $c$ is the root we seek. 

Bisection Method
----

The bisection method exploits the intermediate value theorem to make sure that we always have a interval that contains a root.  First, we will walk through the bisection method for the example and then write it down in general.  

Let $\tilde{a}$ be the midpoint between $a$ and $b$ or $x=0$ and $x=2$ in our case.  That is 
$$\tilde{a} = \frac{a+b}{2} = \frac{0+2}{2}=1$$
There are three choices for $\tilde{a}$.  Either it is 0, then you have found the root or it is less than zero or greater than zero.  Since $f(1)=-1$, then it is less than zero.  Because our left endpoint was less than zero, we replace it with zero.  That is our interval goes from $[0,2]$ to $[1,2]$.  

And then we repeat.  The midpoint of this interval is 1.5 and $f(1.5)=1.5^2-2=0.25$ and since this is positive, we replace the 2 with 1.5 and our new interval is $[1,1.5]$.

###Exercise

Find the next 3 intervals using this technique.  Recall that you always need to have the function value of one side be less than and the other be greater than 0.  

###Stop this crazy thing!!!

Since you are wise, you notice that you can continue this process forever and you just don&apos;t have that much time.  For example, on the tenth iteration, you should have the interval 
```
[1.41406250,1.416015625]
```
and as long as the condition that the funtion values of two endpoints are opposite signs, then there is a guarantee of a root inside this interval.  

Again, we can go on forever, but a good place to stop (often called a halting condition) is when the length of the interval shrinks to a particular size.  Let&#8217;s say that we stop when the length is $10^{-4}$ and then we should return our best guess at the root, which may be the midpoint of the final interval.   If we stop when the interval is less than $10^{-4}$ and take this midpoint, the answer will be 1.414215088.

###Creating a Procedure to do this

This section will slowly build up a procedure that does this.  The goal of this section is to learn how to take an algorithm (explained above) and make a procedure that does this. 


1. Shell of a procedure.  Let&#8217;s start with the declaration of the procedure.  We want to take a function and an interval in and return an approximate root.  

    ```
    bisect:=proc(f::procedure,interval::range)::numeric;

    end proc:
    ```

    This will just do that.  Note that a function type is called a `procedure` and an interval is called a `range`.  The return type will be a number, so `numeric`.  It&#8217;s a good idea to just run this at this point.  

2. Define the midpoint and return it.

    Next, let&#8217;s do something super simple and define the midpoint and then return it.  To get the endpoints of an interval or range, use `lhs` and `rhs`, which stands for left hand side and right hand side respectively.  

    ```
    bisect:=proc(f::procedure,interval::range)::numeric;
       local mid:=0.5*(lhs(interval)+rhs(interval)):
        return mid:
    end proc:
    ```

    and then execute this block of code.  Make sure there are no errors.  Then you can test it using the example above by typing
    ```
    bisect(x->x^2,0..2)
    ```
    and you should get the answer 1.0. 

3. Create a new interval

    Now, let's also create a variable called `inter` that is the new interval.  Recall that you want to make sure that the endpoints of the new interval are opposite signs.  The easiest way to check this is to determine if the product of the function values is negative. 
    
    ```
    bisect:=proc(f::procedure,interval::range)::numeric;
       local mid:=0.5*(lhs(interval)+rhs(interval)):
       local inter:=interval:
       if f(lhs(inter))*f(mid) < 0 then 
           inter := lhs(inter) .. mid
       else 
          inter := mid .. rhs(inter) 
       end if:
       return inter:
    end proc:
    ```

4. Put in a loop to run a few times.

    Next, we will run this a few times using a `for` loop to test the procedure.  
    
    ```
    bisect:=proc(f::procedure,interval::range)::numeric;
       local mid:=0.5*(lhs(interval)+rhs(interval)):
       local inter:=interval:
       local i:
       
       for i to 4 do
         if f(lhs(inter))*f(mid) < 0 then 
           inter := lhs(inter) .. mid 
         else 
           inter := mid .. rhs(inter) 
         end if:
         mid := .5*(lhs(inter)+rhs(inter)):
         print(inter):
        end do;
      return mid
    end proc:
    ```
    
    This will print out the interval to make sure it is working.  YOu should see the interval printed 4 times and then the midpoint returned (and then printed).
    
5. Replace the for loop with a while loop

    We don't want to run this a fixed number of times, but instead, run this until the halting condition. 
    
    We will execute the loop while the length of the interval is greater than $10^{-4}$.  
    
    ```
    bisect := proc (f::procedure, interval::range)::numeric; 
      local mid := .5*(lhs(interval)+rhs(interval)); 
      local inter := interval; 
      while rhs(inter)-lhs(inter) > 10^(-4) do 
        if f(lhs(inter))*f(mid) < 0 then 
          inter := lhs(inter) .. mid 
        else 
          inter := mid .. rhs(inter) 
        end if; 
        mid := .5*(lhs(inter)+rhs(inter)); 
        print(inter):
      end do; 
      return mid:
    end proc:
    ```
    
    If we test the procedure by typing: `bisect(x->x^2-2,0..2)`, you will get 1.414215088.  Note that we can determine the number of digits of accuracy for $\sqrt{2}$ by typing
    ```
    evalf(|sqrt(2)-1.414215088|)
    ```
    will result in 0.000001526 or 5 digits of accuracy.  

6. Adding a parameter for the halting condition.

   If we want the halting condition to be smaller than $10^{-4}$, we will make it a parameter.  Here&#8217;s how that works. 
   
   ```
   bisect := proc (f::procedure, interval::range,{eps=10^(-4)})::numeric; 
      local mid := .5*(lhs(interval)+rhs(interval)); 
      local inter := interval; 
      while rhs(inter)-lhs(inter) > eps do 
        if f(lhs(inter))*f(mid) < 0 then 
          inter := lhs(inter) .. mid 
        else 
          inter := mid .. rhs(inter) 
        end if; 
        mid := .5*(lhs(inter)+rhs(inter)); 
      end do; 
      return mid:
    end proc:
   ```
   and we have removed the print statement because all seems to be working well.  Now if we call this procedure as above, 
   ```
   bisect(x->x^2-2,0..2)
   ``` 
   then we get the same result as above. 
    
   But this allows us to get more precision.  Type
   ```
   bisect(x->x^2-2,0..2,eps=10^(-7))
   ```

gives this time 8 digits of accuracy.
