Linear Algebra
===========

Linear Algebra in a huge field of mathematics and many standard operations in linear algebra is done in Maple or other CAS software. The core of Linear Algebra is a matrix, a rectangular grid of numbers.  

Linear Algebra library
-------

The Linear Algebra library has many more commands that can be used.  To load it type
```
with(LinearAlgebra):
```

and take a look at the help page for it:
```
?LinearAlgebra
```

Vectors
-----

There are two standard types of Vectors, column vectors and row vectors and Maple has both.  If you want to enter the vector
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ -2 \\ 3 \end{array} \right]$$

you can type:
```
v:=Vector([4,-2,3])
```

and let's say that you have a vector
```
w:=Vector([2,0,3])
```

which will be another column vector.   If you want a row vector, like
$$ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array}\right]$$
you can enter this as
```
Vector[row]([1,2,3])
```

Check out other ways to create a vector using `?Vector`

###Dot and Cross Products

You can take the dot product of two column vectors of the same length with the command `DotProduct`, which is part of the `LinearAlgebra` library.  For example
```
DotProduct(v,w)
```

returns 17.  

and to find the cross product, try
```
CrossProduct(v,w)
```

which returns the vector
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} -6 \\ -6 \\ 4 \end{array}\right]$$




Matrices
-----

To enter a matrix in Maple, it is entered row by row. Consider the matrix:
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \end{array} \right]$$
you can enter this as
```
A:=Matrix([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]])
```

or you can use the Matrix palette.  Enter the number of rows as 3 and columns as 4 and leave the Type as *Custom Values* and Maple will insert a generic 3 by 4 matrix.  You can tab to get to each of the elements of the matrix.  

Let's also define the matrix $B$ to be a 3 by 4 matrix of all ones, which can be done with
```
B:=Matrix(3,4,fill=1)
```

and this will look like:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$$


And a 3 by 3 matrix with the numbers 2, $-1$ and 4 on the diagonal, 
```
C:=DiagonalMatrix([2,-1,4],3,3)
```

and this will look like
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 2 & 0 & 0  \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{array} \right]$$

###Adding and Subtracting Matrices

We can add the matrices $A$ and $B$ because they are the same size and can using standard notation:
```
A+B
```

which will return:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}  2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\  6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 \end{array} \right]$$

and if we subtract
```
A-B
```

Maple returns
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ 8 & 9 & 10 & 11  \end{array} \right]$$


If we try to add $A$ and $C$, we get the error:
```
Error, (in rtable/Sum) invalid input: dimensions do not match: Matrix(1 .. 3, 1 .. 4) cannot be added to Matrix(1 .. 3, 1 .. 3)
```

this is because the two matrices are not the same size.  

###Scalar multiplication

Recall that Scalar multiplication of either a vector or a matrix results in a vector a matrix that is the product of the scalar and each element of the vector or matrix.  For example, $3v$ for the vector $v$ above is
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 12 \\ -6 \\ 9\end{array}\right]$$
and $-2A$ is 

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} -2&-4&-6&-8\\ -10&-12&-
14&-16\\-18&-20&-22&-24\end {array} \right]$$

###Multiplying Matrices

Recall that two multiply 2 matrices, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix.  For example if we have the matrix
```
P:=Matrix([[3,2,0],[1,-2,4],[0,2,5]])
```

If we multiply $P$ and $A$, we use Maple's dot notation or $P.A$ to get

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 13&18&23&28\\ 27&30&33&
36\\ 55&62&69&76\end {array} \right]$$


We can also use the dot notation to multiply matrices and vectors.  For example, $P.v$ is 

$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 8\\20\\11\end{array}\right]$$

If we don't have compatibly-sized matrices, for example, $A$ and $B$, and try $A.B$, we get:
```
Error, (in LinearAlgebra:-Multiply) first matrix column dimension (4) <> second matrix row dimension (3)
```

###Exercise

Let 

$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 3 \\ -2 & 4 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right]$$
$$B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ -1 &4 & -1 \end{array}\right]$$
$$C=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 &4 \\ -2 & 1 \end{array}\right]$$
$$\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]$$
$$\vec{u} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 5 \\ -2 \end{array}\right]$$


Find the following or state the operation is not compatible. 

1. $AB$
2. $AC$
3. $BC$
4. $A^TB$
5. $A\vec{v}$
6. $A\vec{u}$
7. $B\vec{u}$.  

Matrix Transpose
-------

Recall that the transpose of a matrix is a new matrix where the rows of the tranpose are the columns of the original matrix.  For example,

$$A^{T} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 5 & 9 \\ 2 & 6 & 10 \\ 3 & 7 & 11 \\ 4 & 8 & 12 \end{array}\right]$$

This can be done in Maple using the `Tranpose` command:
```
Transpose(A)
```

returns the matrix above.   (Note: Transpose is in the `LinearAlgebra` package so make sure that it is loaded.)
