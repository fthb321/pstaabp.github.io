Linear Algebra
===========

Linear Algebra in a huge field of mathematics and many standard operations in linear algebra is done in Maple or other CAS software. The core of Linear Algebra is a matrix, a rectangular grid of numbers.  

Linear Algebra library
-------

The Linear Algebra library has many more commands that can be used.  To load it type
```
with(LinearAlgebra):
```

and take a look at the help page for it:
```
?LinearAlgebra
```

Vectors
-----

There are two standard types of Vectors, column vectors and row vectors and Maple has both.  If you want to enter the vector
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ -2 \\ 3 \end{array} \right]$$

you can type:
```
v:=Vector([4,-2,3])
```

and let's say that you have a vector
```
w:=Vector([2,0,3])
```

which will be another column vector.   If you want a row vector, like
$$ \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array}\right]$$
you can enter this as
```
Vector[row]([1,2,3])
```

Check out other ways to create a vector using `?Vector`

###Dot and Cross Products

You can take the dot product of two column vectors of the same length with the command `DotProduct`, which is part of the `LinearAlgebra` library.  For example
```
DotProduct(v,w)
```

returns 17.  

and to find the cross product, try
```
CrossProduct(v,w)
```

which returns the vector
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} -6 \\ -6 \\ 4 \end{array}\right]$$




Matrices
-----

To enter a matrix in Maple, it is entered row by row. Consider the matrix:
$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \end{array} \right]$$
you can enter this as
```
A:=Matrix([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]])
```

or you can use the Matrix palette.  Enter the number of rows as 3 and columns as 4 and leave the Type as *Custom Values* and Maple will insert a generic 3 by 4 matrix.  You can tab to get to each of the elements of the matrix.  

Let's also define the matrix $B$ to be a 3 by 4 matrix of all ones, which can be done with
```
B:=Matrix(3,4,fill=1)
```

and this will look like:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$$


And a 3 by 3 matrix with the numbers 2, $-1$ and 4 on the diagonal, 
```
C:=DiagonalMatrix([2,-1,4],3,3)
```

and this will look like
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 2 & 0 & 0  \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \end{array} \right]$$

###Adding and Subtracting Matrices

We can add the matrices $A$ and $B$ because they are the same size and can using standard notation:
```
A+B
```

which will return:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}  2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\  6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 \end{array} \right]$$

and if we subtract
```
A-B
```

Maple returns
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ 8 & 9 & 10 & 11  \end{array} \right]$$


If we try to add $A$ and $C$, we get the error:
```
Error, (in rtable/Sum) invalid input: dimensions do not match: Matrix(1 .. 3, 1 .. 4) cannot be added to Matrix(1 .. 3, 1 .. 3)
```

this is because the two matrices are not the same size.  

###Scalar multiplication

Recall that Scalar multiplication of either a vector or a matrix results in a vector a matrix that is the product of the scalar and each element of the vector or matrix.  For example, $3v$ for the vector $v$ above is
$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 12 \\ -6 \\ 9\end{array}\right]$$
and $-2A$ is 

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} -2&-4&-6&-8\\ -10&-12&-
14&-16\\-18&-20&-22&-24\end {array} \right]$$

###Multiplying Matrices

Recall that two multiply 2 matrices, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of rows of the second matrix.  For example if we have the matrix
```
P:=Matrix([[3,2,0],[1,-2,4],[0,2,5]])
```

If we multiply $P$ and $A$, we use Maple's dot notation or $P.A$ to get

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccc} 13&18&23&28\\ 27&30&33&
36\\ 55&62&69&76\end {array} \right]$$


We can also use the dot notation to multiply matrices and vectors.  For example, $P.v$ is 

$$\left[\begin{array}{c} 8\\20\\11\end{array}\right]$$

If we don't have compatibly-sized matrices, for example, $A$ and $B$, and try $A.B$, we get:
```
Error, (in LinearAlgebra:-Multiply) first matrix column dimension (4) <> second matrix row dimension (3)
```

###Exercise

Let 

$$A=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 3 \\ -2 & 4 \\ 5 & 0\end{array}\right]$$
$$B=\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ -1 &4 & -1 \end{array}\right]$$
$$C=\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 &4 \\ -2 & 1 \end{array}\right]$$
$$\vec{v} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 2 \end{array}\right]$$
$$\vec{u} = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 5 \\ -2 \end{array}\right]$$


Find the following or state the operation is not compatible. 

1. $AB$
2. $AC$
3. $BC$
4. $A^TB$
5. $A\vec{v}$
6. $A\vec{u}$
7. $B\vec{u}$.  

Idenity Matrix
--------

A square matrix with all zeros except 1's on the diagonal, is called an *identity matrix*.  The identity matrices of size 2 by 2, 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 are

$$\begin{array}{ccc}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\end{array}\right]&\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{array}\right]&
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$

An identity matrix has the property that if you mulitply a matrix or a vector by the identity matrix, the matrix or vector is returned.  More particularly,
$$\begin{array}{cccc}IA=A & AI=A & I\vec{v}=\vec{v} & \vec{v}I=\vec{v}\end{array}$$

To get an Identity matrix in Maple, use the `IdentityMatrix` command. For example
```
IdentityMatrix(3)
```

returns a 3 by 3 identity matrix. 

###Exercise

Using the vector $\vec{v}$ and matrix $A$ above, find

1. $I\vec{v}$
2. $\vec{v}I$
3. $IA$
4. $AI$.

and show that you get the vector or matrix back. Make sure that you use the identity matrix of the correct size.  


Matrix Transpose
-------

Recall that the transpose of a matrix is a new matrix where the rows of the tranpose are the columns of the original matrix.  For example,

$$A^{T} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 5 & 9 \\ 2 & 6 & 10 \\ 3 & 7 & 11 \\ 4 & 8 & 12 \end{array}\right]$$

This can be done in Maple using the `Tranpose` command:
```
Transpose(A)
```

returns the matrix above.   (Note: Transpose is in the `LinearAlgebra` package so make sure that it is loaded.)

Gaussian Elimination
--------

One of the first concepts in linear algebra is how to solve linear systems.  For example, 
$$\begin{array}{rl} 3x- 2y & = 4 \\
x + 5y & = 7 \end{array}$$

Maple can solve this by using the `solve` command such as
```
solve([3x-2y=4,x+5y=7])
```

which returns $\{x=2,y=1\}$.  In linear algebra, we find the augmented coefficient matrix as 
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & -2 & 4 \\ 1 & 5 & 7 \end{array}\right]$$

One method is to use row operations on the matix to reduce the matrix to a more useful form.  One of these is called *Gaussian Elimination*.  If we define the matrix above by $A$, then in Maple,
```
GaussianElimination(A)
```

returns $$ \left[ \begin {array}{ccc} 3&-2&4\newline 
0&17/3&17/3\end {array} \right]$$

To find the solution, we can use *back substitution*

The last row can be written back in equation form as
$$\frac{17}{3} y = \frac{17}{3}$$  
or $y=1$.  Then writting the first equation:
$$3x-2y=4$$
or substituting in $y=1$
$$\begin{array}{rl}3x-2(1)& =4\\ 
3x& = 6 \\
x & = 2\end{array}$$


Reduced Row Echelon Form
--------

Maple can help us even more.  If we type:
```
ReducedRowEchelonForm(A)
```

This returns:
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 2\\0 &1 &1\end{array}\right]$$
and this can be written as the two equations $x=2$, $y=1$, same as above. 

###Exercise

The linear system
$$\begin{array}{rl}-3x+4y-5z & = 8\\
-4x-2y-z & = 0 \\
5x-4y+3z & = -16\end{array}$$
can be written as an Augmented Coefficient Matrix:
$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}-3 & 4 & -5 & 8\\
-4&-2&-1&0\\5&-4&3&-16\end{array}\right]$$

Use `ReducedRowEchelonForm` to reduce the matrix and then write the solution. 

Determinants
-------

The [determinant of a matrix](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-determinant.html) is helpful in many different matrix applications including determining if the matrix is singular and it can be used in solving linear systems using [Cramer's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule).

The determinant is applied only to square matrices and is denoted ${\rm det}(A)$ or $|A|$.  If the matrix is a 2 by 2, then 
$$\left|\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right|=ad-bc$$

When finding a determinant, often Laplace's Expansion method or row operations are used to find the value.  For example

$$\left|\begin {array}{ccc} 2&-3&1\\ 3&3&0\\2&3&-3\end {array} \right|=2\left|\begin{array}{cc}3&0\\3&-3\end{array}\right|-(-3)\left|\begin{array}{cc}3&0\\2&-3\end{array}\right|+1\left|\begin{array}{cc}3&3\\2&3\end{array}\right|$$

$$\begin{array}{rl}&=2\left((3)(-3)-(3)(0)\right)+3\left((3)(-3)-2(0)\right)+\left((3)(3)-2(3)\right)\\
&=2(-9)+3(-9)+(9-6)=-42\end{array}$$

And using Maple on the 3 by 3 matrix $A$ above  (again this in the `LinearAlgebra` library)
```
Determinant(A)
```

returns $-42$ as well. 

Matrix Inverse
---------

If a matrix, $A$ is square and it's determiant is not zero, then there exists a matrix called the *inverse* and denoted with the property $AA^{-1}=I$, 

One way to find the matrix inverse of $A$ is write the matrix augmented with the identity matrix and then put it in Reduced Row echelon form. 

For example, consider the matrix 

$$A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-3&4&-5\\-4&-2&-1\\5&-4&3\end{array}\right]$$
then we write the matrix:
$$Aug=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}-3&4&-5&1&0&0\\-4&-2&-1&0&1&0\\5&-4&3&0&0&1\end{array}\right]$$

and using the `ReducedRowEchelonForm` command, we get:

$$\left[ \begin {array}{cccccc} 1&0&0&{\frac {5}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&{\frac {7}{
36}}\newline 0&1&0&-{\frac {7}{72}}&-\frac{2}{9}&-{\frac {17}{72}}
\newline 0&0&1&-{\frac {13}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&-{\frac {11}{36}}
\end {array} \right] $$

and the right half of the matrix is the inverse or 
$$A^{-1}=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} {\frac {5}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&{\frac {7}{
36}}\newline -{\frac {7}{72}}&-\frac{2}{9}&-{\frac {17}{72}}
\newline -{\frac {13}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&-{\frac {11}{36}}
\end {array} \right]$$


We can also get the same result from the command `MatrixInverse`:
```
MatrixInverse(A)
```

returns the same matrix above.  

###Exercise

1. Find the inverse of
    $$C=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} -1&-3&0\\-3&2&-1\\1&-3&0\end {array} \right]$$
    using the augmented matrix with the identity matrix. 
2. Find the inverse of $C$ using the command `MatrixInverse`
3. What happens when you try to find the inverse of $$\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} -1&-3&0\\-3&2&-1\\2&-5&1\end{array}\right]?$$




###Using the Matrix Inverse to solve a linear system. 

Above we saw the linear system:

The linear system
$$\begin{array}{rl}-3x+4y-5z & = 8\\
-4x-2y-z & = 0 \\
5x-4y+3z & = -16\end{array}$$

and used the Augumented Matrix to find the solution.  Instead, we can write:
$$\begin{array}{rl}A=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} -3&4&-5\\-4&-2&-1
\\5&-4&3\end {array} \right]&\vec{b}=\left[\begin{array}{c}8\\0\\-16\end{array}\right]\end{array}$$

and then if we write the vector
$$\vec{x}=\left[\begin{array}{c}x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]$$, then the linear system can be written as $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$. We can solve this in the following way.
$$A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$$
Multiply the equation by $A^{-1}$
$$\begin{array}{rl}A^{-1}A\vec{x}&=A^{-1}\vec{b}\\
\text{since $A^{-1}A=I\qquad\qquad$}&\\
I\vec{x}&=A^{-1}\vec{b}\\
\text{since $I\vec{x}=\vec{x}\qquad\qquad$}&\\
\vec{x}&=A^{-1}\vec{b}\end{array}$$

Use this to solve the linear system above. 

First, we will find $A^{-1}$ using the `MatrixInverse` command:
```
Ainv:=MatrixInverse(A)
```

which returns
$$\left[ \begin {array}{ccc} {\frac {5}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&{\frac {7}{
36}}\newline -{\frac {7}{72}}&-\frac{2}{9}&-{\frac {17}{72}}
\newline -{\frac {13}{36}}&-\frac{1}{9}&-{\frac {11}{36}}
\end {array} \right]$$
as we saw above.  

Lastly, we multiply $A^{-1}$ and $\vec{b}$
```
Ainv.b
```

to get:
$$\left[\begin{array}{c}-2\\3\\2\end{array}\right]$$

so the result is $x=-2,y=3,z=2$, the same as we found above.  

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
--------

Another important topic in Linear Algebra is that of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Recall that a scalar (number) $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of a matrix $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $\vec{v}$ if this satisfies the equation
$$A\vec{v}=\lambda\vec{v}$$
